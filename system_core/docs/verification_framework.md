# Verification and Validation Framework Implementation Plan

## Objective
To implement the "Verification and Validation Framework" as described in the user's message, ensuring the Central Error Detection System meets technical, functional, and organizational requirements.

## Progress Tracking

### 1. Technical Infrastructure Compliance
- [x] Correlation IDs Verification Script
- [ ] OTLP Transport Protocol Validation
- [x] ECS/Schema Consistency Check
- [ ] Collector Performance Baseline

### 2. Error Scenarios & Functional Logic (Chaos Engineering)
- [x] Chaos Scenario 1: Service Failure Detection
- [x] Chaos Scenario 2: Network Latency Injection
- [x] Chaos Scenario 3: Message Duplication (Idempotency)
- [ ] Logical Conflict Detection (Race Condition)

### 3. AIOps & Alert Storm Intelligence
- [ ] Golden Dataset Integration
- [x] Noise Reduction Rate Metric Calculation
- [ ] Root Cause Accuracy Validation
- [ ] LLM Summary Quality Audit

### 4. Duplicate System Detection
- [x] "Needle in a Haystack" Functional Test
- [x] Precision & Recall Metric Tracking

### 5. Operational & Process Validation
- [x] KPI Dashboard (MTTR, MTTA, Coverage)
- [x] Escalation Path Simulation
