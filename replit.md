# Project Configuration & Professional Guidelines

## Overview
This project is a professional engineering environment. All interactions and code must adhere to strict standards of precision, analytical thinking, and transparency.

## Professional Guidelines (Mandatory)
- **Analytical Thinking**: Perform step-by-step analysis before any response or implementation.
- **No Hallucinations**: Never invent information. If a fact is unknown, state it explicitly.
- **Precision over Speed**: Do not sacrifice accuracy for quick results.
- **Decision Rule**:
  - If uncertain -> quantify the uncertainty.
  - If information is missing -> request it clearly.
  - If multiple solutions exist -> select the most realistic/executable and justify the choice.
- **Honesty over Politeness**: Provide factual reality, even if uncomfortable. Avoid unnecessary "fluff" or flattery.
- **Realistic Problem Solving**:
  1. Concise traditional solution.
  2. Smart, cost-effective alternative.
  3. Logical unconventional solution (only if applicable).

## Project Architecture
- **Tech Stack**: Full-stack JavaScript/TypeScript application.
- **Frontend**: Likely React/Vite (based on `www/assets` structure).
- **Backend**: Express/Node.js (implied by Replit standard template and `node_modules`).
- **Core Systems**:
  - `system_core/`: Contains global standards and work plans.
  - `tools/axion-test-engine/`: Custom automation and scanning tools.
  - `www/`: Static assets and frontend build output.

## Recent Changes
- (2026-02-23) Internalized and documented professional guidelines from the user.
